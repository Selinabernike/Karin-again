        <h1>Thank You for Coming Into My Life, Karina</h1>
        <p>
            Every moment spent with you is a treasure that I hold dear. 
            Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your laughter is music 
            to my soul. I am eternally grateful for the beautiful journey we share.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meeting you felt like a dream; your kindness and warmth have made 
            my world a better place. Thank you for being youâ€”truly amazing 
            and wonderfully inspiring.
